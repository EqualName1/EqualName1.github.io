      <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
      <p>As you may have read before, my name is Ethan. I am 16 years and I am currently practicing coding. My hobbies, besides coding, include reading and drawing.</p>
      <p> I love programming and writing code, however I have only done so for games and this is my first time using JavaScript to code websites</p>
      <p>I have been a self taught programmer for about 1 year though half of that year was spent actually learning instead of practicing so I am still at a beginner level</p>
      <p>These are a few things I have accomplished on my journey as a programmer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-I coded pong</li>
        <li>-I consider myself atleast capable of coding in GML</li>
        <li>-I am busy working on my own game called "The Magical Bookstore</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As of right now I still consider myself very new to coding but I did code this site so I don't, anyways thanks for checking this section and hope you stick around for the growth of the website</p>
